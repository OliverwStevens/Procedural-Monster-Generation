# Procedural-Monster-Generation

The asset includes 35 lowpoly 3D models which act as the body parts of a creature. It also contains 5 animated heads with LODs. Creatures and herds are built on runtime using a script. The user can configure the creatures' settings (e.g. how many body segements) as they please. More body parts can easily be made for the generator in a 3D software. 

Body parts, audio effects, colors, and various stats are all procedurally generated from a user's settings. 

The creatures are procedurally animated come with configurable behavior, responding realistically to predators and threats. Herds of creatures can work together to survive or live a solitary life.

Instead of modeling, sculpting, rigging, and animating for hours on end, just drag, drop, and customize. Watch creatures bring new life to games.
